This project focuses on developing a Speech-to-Text system designed to facilitate automated transcription services. The notebook likely includes the following components:

Audio Input Handling: Uploading or recording audio files for processing.

Preprocessing: Techniques such as noise reduction, normalization, or segmentation of audio signals.

Speech Recognition: Using models like Google's Speech Recognition API, Whisper by OpenAI, or other libraries (e.g., SpeechRecognition, pydub, transformers) to convert spoken words into text.

Post-processing: Cleaning and formatting the output text, possibly including punctuation correction or speaker diarization.

Evaluation: Comparing the transcribed text with ground truth to measure accuracy (e.g., using Word Error Rate).
